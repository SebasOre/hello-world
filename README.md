# hello-world
My first repository

As the description says, this is my first attempt at a repository.

Once again, im trying out how to edit repositories and what are pull requests.
R: So I have not committed changes as of yet, now, I should try to make a deliberate commit.

So, if I don't fill the commuit changes bubble, do the changes actually commit?
R: It seems like no, I do have to fill the commit changes bubble for a pull request to be createad.
R2: Let's try again
